This little utility is intended to act as a swiss army knife for
accessing various data and functions build around the Flukso power
metering device, which is used in the http://www.mysmartgrid.de projekt.

It is currently in a very early stage and has only a few functions:

1. Output the last valid value delivered to the database on the website
2. Check the freshness of the delivery process.

The code depends on json-c, curl and popt. It can be used to monitor a
Flukso like this:

./flukso-checkhealth -d -t bb8640e074de14b9d444be7b1359707f -s 67e9fa794684e4902730be208e9d734e -i hour -v -m 3

The sensor and token match to the "official" Flukso of Fraunhofer ITWMs
CC-HPC. It can be used for development.
