This little utility is intended to act as a swiss army knife for
accessing various data and functions build around the Flukso power
metering device, which is used in the http://www.mysmartgrid.de projekt. 
The initial code was developed by Henning Bitsch and then extended 
by Mathias Dalheimer. It is provided as-is under the terms of the GPLv3
license.

The code depends on json-c, curl and popt. It can be used to retrieve 
values from a Flukso like this:

./flukso-getvalue -d -t bb8640e074de14b9d444be7b1359707f -s 67e9fa794684e4902730be208e9d734e -i hour -v -m 3

The sensor and token above match to the "official" Flukso of Fraunhofer ITWMs
CC-HPC. It can be used for development.

TODO:
- Re-integrate Nagios monitoring code (as a separate exporter)
- Develop chumby daemon
